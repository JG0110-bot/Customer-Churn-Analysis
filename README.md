# Customer Churn Analysis (SQL)

## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills in customer churn analysis. It includes database creation, data manipulation, and querying to identify churned customers based on the last purchase date.

## Key Features
- **Database Management**: Creates and structures a relational database.
- **Data Insertion**: Populates tables with sample data.
- **Churn Analysis**: Uses SQL logic to classify customers as 'Active' or 'Churned' based on purchase history.
- **Efficient Querying**: Implements date functions and conditional statements for analysis.

## SQL Concepts Used
- **Table Creation & Constraints** (`AUTO_INCREMENT`, `PRIMARY KEY`)
- **Data Manipulation** (`INSERT INTO`)
- **Conditional Logic** (`CASE WHEN`)
- **Date Functions** (`CURDATE()`, `INTERVAL`)

## How to Use
1. **Setup the Database**: Run the provided SQL script.
2. **Insert Data**: Execute sample data insertion.
3. **Analyze Churn**: Run the churn query to identify inactive customers.
4. **Customize**: Adjust the `INTERVAL` condition as needed.
